# STUDENT RESULT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
<p>The Student Result Management System (SRMS) project aims to modernize and simplify result management in educational institutions. The project is structured around three essential elements:
  <ul>
    <li>The Result Section (front-end)</li>
    <li>The Database (storage)</li>
    <li>The Admin Section (back-end)</li>
  </ul>The SRMS project aims to improve access to academic data, reduce administrative burdens for administrators, and enhance data security. The project follows a top-down approach, starting from the end goal and moving towards the database, data storage, and administrative tasks. The main goals include database normalization, execution of diverse queries, automation of student information inclusion and alteration, establishment of an authentication system for administrators, and producing results in PDF format and enabling downloads.</p>
